GildedWindow is the name of my project to provide a limited functionality window between
the web and Second Life. It will run on a server and make http function calls to and from 
prims inworld which scan and return information, plus display info about the web
clients.  Chat is exchanged between the two as well and stl files are transferred and 
displayed.
