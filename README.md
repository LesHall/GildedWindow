GildedWindow is the name of my project to provide a limited functionality window between the web and Second Life. It will run on a server and make http function calls to and from prims inworld which scan and return information, plus display info about the web clients.  Chat is exchanged between the two as well and stl files are transferred and displayed.  

At this time all it does is handle five lines of text input (the zeroth line is what you type on) and spin a box around in 3D as a placeholder for the graphics.
